Dashboard framework
===================

The dashboard framework is a Qt framework that allows displaying widgets like components on a
surface. Those widgets can be moved around and configured.

The dashboard framework is meant to be used in Sailfish OS, to provide a flexible environnement
where system widgets can appear inside homescreen.
